This project takes as input several physiological parameters of a person, including number of pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, Body-Mass Index(BMI), Diabetes Pedigree Function(dpf), and age, and uses Supervised  Learning  to train a Random Forest Classifier on our datatset  to predict whether the person has diabetes or not. The tools utilised while developing this project are python, flask and heroku.
